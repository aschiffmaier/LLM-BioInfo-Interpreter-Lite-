# LLM-BioInfo-Interpreter-Lite-
Simulated prototype of a large language model (LLM) tool designed to interpret biochemical datasets such as microarray or RNA-seq data. This version loads gene expression data and prepares structured prompts for analysis.

# LLM Bioinformatics Interpreter (Lite)

A lightweight, fully offline prototype of a large language model (LLM) strategy tool for analyzing biochemical datasets such as microarray or RNA-seq.

This tool simulates the workflow of interpreting gene expression changes using LLMs like GPT-4 or BioGPT, without invoking any AI APIs. All prompts and interpretations are handcrafted for demonstration purposes.
